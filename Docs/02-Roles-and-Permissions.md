### **3. Detailed Role Definitions**

---

## **🧍‍♂️ Requester**

*(Principals, Department Heads, or Authorized Staff Members)*

#### **Purpose:**

Initiate, collaborate, and finalize internal service or maintenance requests within their department or across departments.

#### **Core Responsibilities:**

* Create and submit new tickets for departmental issues or needs.

* Edit or cancel drafts **before final submission only** (cannot edit after submission).

* Attach relevant documents, images, or forms.

* Monitor ticket status through dashboards or email notifications.

* Mark requests as *resolved* once satisfied with the outcome.

* Provide closure feedback for quality and satisfaction tracking.

#### **Enhanced Collaboration Features:**

* Participate in **real-time ticket chat** with connected users (Moderator, Assignee, and Sub-ticket participants).

* Request the Moderator (via chat) to:

  * Add other departments if the issue spans multiple areas.

  * **Note:** Requester cannot request sub-tickets directly. Only Assignee can request sub-tickets via chat.

* Stay informed through notifications about:

  * Priority or time changes.

  * Ticket postponement or restarts.

  * Moderator or Assignee comments.

#### **Access & Visibility:**

* Can view and track **only self-created or linked tickets**.

* Access to limited **personal analytics**, such as resolution time and number of requests.

#### **Key Value:**

Makes the requester an *active participant* in the lifecycle rather than a passive initiator — improving engagement and faster resolutions.

## **🧭 Moderator**

*(Helpdesk Officer or Core System Operator)*

#### **Purpose:**

Serve as the **workflow controller**, ensuring all tickets are valid, properly categorized, and routed to the right department efficiently.

#### **Core Responsibilities:**

* Review and validate all incoming tickets.

* Correct ticket categories, priority levels, and department mappings if necessary.

* Approve, reject, or return tickets for clarification.

* **Rejected tickets** mark the end of lifecycle (cannot be reopened).

* Assign tickets to the appropriate department (Assignee).

* **ONLY Moderator can create sub-tickets** while maintaining parent-child relationships.

* Monitor ticket aging and remind departments about pending work.

* Verify closure and ensure resolution quality before final approval.

#### **Enhanced Capabilities:**

* **Load-based assignment:** View department workloads and employee availability before assigning new tasks.

* **Dynamic control:** Adjust priority levels or custom SLAs (ticket completion times) based on urgency or staff availability.

* **Ticket postponement:** Temporarily pause a ticket with a **required reason**; system sends auto-reminders every 3 days for follow-up until ticket is closed or restarted.

* **Real-time moderation:**

  * Add or remove chat participants as needed.

  * Merge sub-tickets back into the parent for final resolution.

  * Track dependencies between departments.

* **Undo capability:** Can undo actions (reject, assign, postpone) within **15 minutes** of performing the action.

* **Communication:** Maintain open dialogue with both Requesters and Assignees to resolve delays or missing details.

#### **Access & Visibility:**

* Full visibility of all tickets across departments.

* Can see **full chat history** for all tickets (unlike new participants who only see messages after their join time).

* Cannot alter system configuration or user permissions (Admin-only domain).

#### **Key Value:**

Acts as a **traffic controller and quality gatekeeper**, ensuring fairness, accountability, and balanced workloads across the organization.

## **🧩 Assignee**

*(Department Head or Authorized Team Lead)*

#### **Purpose:**

Execute and oversee ticket resolution for their respective department.

#### **Core Responsibilities:**

* View and manage tickets assigned to their department.

* **Assign internal team members/employees** to tickets for acknowledgment and tracking. **Note:** Team members are system users assigned to departments by Admin. All ticket updates must be done by Department Head only (employees don't update tickets).

* Communicate updates and status changes (In Progress → Completed).

* Provide completion notes or attach proofs of work (documents, receipts, reports).

* Notify the Moderator of dependencies or resource issues.

* Close their departmental tasks upon completion.

* **Create internal task breakdown** for employees (separate from system sub-tickets - this is for department-level task management).

#### **Enhanced Capabilities:**

* Participate in **real-time chat** with Moderator and Requester.

* **Request Moderator to create linked sub-tickets** for other departments if the task extends beyond their scope. **Note:** Assignee cannot create sub-tickets directly; must request via chat with `request_subticket` flag.

* Monitor **departmental metrics** (active tickets, pending count, completion rate).

* Escalate issues internally for faster turnaround.

#### **Access & Visibility:**

* Limited to tickets of their own department.

* Cannot modify or access cross-department data.

#### **Key Value:**

Empowers department heads with visibility and coordination tools while maintaining accountability for departmental performance.
