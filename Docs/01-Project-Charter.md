## **PROJECT GOALS — *Help Desk Management System (HDMS) for Idara Al-Khair***

###  **Primary Objective**

To develop an **internal help desk management system** that centralizes all organizational requests, automates approval hierarchies, and enables transparent tracking across departments — eliminating the reliance on informal communication channels such as WhatsApp and improving overall operational efficiency.

---

###  **Key Goals**

1. **Streamline Approval Workflow:**  
    Replace the current manual approval process (e.g., cheque or procurement requests sent directly to the CEO) with an automated, hierarchical ticket system that routes requests through relevant departments and approvers.

2. **Enable End-to-End Ticket Management:**  
    Allow staff from all departments (Media, Design, Marketing, Accounts, HR, IT, Admin, etc.) to **submit, track, and resolve** requests efficiently through categorized tickets.

3. **Introduce Linked/Sub-Tickets Functionality:**  
    Support **interconnected tickets**, where a primary ticket (e.g., IT request) can trigger **sub-tickets** (e.g., Accounts approval, Procurement action), enabling multi-department collaboration within a single workflow. **Note:** Only Moderator can create sub-tickets; Assignees can request them via chat.

4. **Centralize Communication:**  
    Build an in-system **comment and discussion section** to connect all involved stakeholders (from requester to approver to CEO) within the same ticket — ensuring transparency and accountability.

5. **Implement Analytics & Insights:**  
    Provide an **analytics dashboard** showing:

   * Department-wise ticket volumes and resolution rates

   * Bottlenecks and delays

   * Staff performance metrics

   * Requester satisfaction scores

6. **Establish a Foundation for AI Automation:**  
    Lay the groundwork for future integrations like:

   * AI-based ticket categorization

   * SLA tracking

   * Automated escalation

   * Voice-based ticket submission

   * AI orchestrator for smart workflow suggestions

**7. Centralized Employee Access Integration:**

Integrate the Help Desk Management System (HDMS) with the existing School Management System (SMS) to ensure a unified employee database. This will allow authorized users (e.g., teachers, coordinators, principals) to access the help desk using their existing employee credentials, ensuring consistency and reducing duplicate data management.

8. To create a unified, real-time collaborative Help Desk platform for internal communication, enabling connected departmental users to resolve issues efficiently without external tools like WhatsApp.

---

### **🕐 Short-Term (1-Month MVP) Focus**

* Build the **core ticketing system** with multi-department workflows

* Enable **basic approval hierarchy** and **commenting**

* Deploy an **admin dashboard** for the CEO and department heads to view real-time updates

* Ensure the system is stable and ready for internal rollout

---

##  **PROJECT SCOPE — *Help Desk Management System (HDMS) MVP (1-Month Phase)***

###  **In Scope (MVP Phase)**

The MVP will focus on designing, developing, and deploying the **core internal ticketing system** for the following departments:

* **Development**

* **Finance & Accounts**

* **Procurement**

* **Basic Maintenance**

* **IT**

* **Architecture**

* **Administration**

Each department will be able to:

1. **Submit new requests/tickets** related to their operations.

2. **Assign and escalate** tickets within the organizational hierarchy.

3. **Collaborate** through an internal **comment/chat system** within each ticket.

4. **Request sub-tickets via Moderator** for cross-department dependencies (e.g., IT → Accounts → CEO approval). **Note:** Only Moderator can create sub-tickets; Assignees can request them.

5. **Track ticket progress** using real-time status updates (Draft → Submitted → Pending → Under_Review → Assigned → In_Progress → Waiting_Approval → Approved/Rejected → Resolved → Closed).

6. **Generate summaries or reports** viewable by department heads and the CEO.
